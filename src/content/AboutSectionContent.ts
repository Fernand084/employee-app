  text: `I’m a self-taught Java developer with 10 years of experience working mostly on the financial industry.
I used to work as a customer service rep for tech companies providing tech support for almost 10 years. This jobs gave me the soft skills to be able to communicate with all sort of people, from experts to non-tech savvy. I believe that everyone that work at the tech industry should at least spend a year working on customer service because it teaches you really valuable skills like active listening, multi-tasking, empathy and overall how to communicate effectively.
I started learning java on 2014, I’ve come a long way now and I can say it’s the best decision I’ve made in my life because learning to program teaches you how to think and how to approach new problems in a structured way, it makes you a problem solver!.
Thanks to this in the past 10 years I’ve learned a lot, from math to cooking and so much things that I didn’t bother to learn before because “I wasn’t cut for that”. I learned that no matter how difficult a problem may be, if you’re able to understand it, you’ll find the solution.
Not gonna lie, I have still much to learn and that’s why I’d created this demo app, because there’s no better way to learn something than putting your knowledge to practice.
