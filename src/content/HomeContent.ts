  and while I do have a couple of projects hosted on Github, I realized that the projects are either incomplete or lack the instructions to make them runnable. Also I don’t think people may be willing to put the effort to figure out how to make’em run just to see some lousy text on screen. 
  I do need something for ready and available for people to interact with.

So I’ve decided to create this small demo api that reads data from a postgresql database and expose different endpoints that are being consumed through this front end react app.`
